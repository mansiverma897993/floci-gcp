## Why floci-gcp?

**No account required.** No auth tokens, no sign-ups, no telemetry. Pull the image and start building.

**Single port.** All GCP services — gRPC and REST — on port `4578` via ALPN negotiation. No per-service setup.

**No feature gates.** Every feature is available to everyone — no community-edition restrictions.

**No CI restrictions.** Run in your CI pipeline with zero limitations. No credits, no quotas, no paid tiers.

**Truly open source.** MIT licensed. Fork it, extend it, embed it.

## Quick Start

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  floci-gcp:
    image: floci/floci-gcp:latest
    ports:
      - "4578:4578"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    environment:
      FLOCI_GCP_HOSTNAME: floci-gcp
      FLOCI_GCP_BASE_URL: http://floci-gcp:4578
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Point your GCP SDKs at the emulator:

```bash
export PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:4578
export FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:4578
export DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:4578
export STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST=http://localhost:4578
export SECRET_MANAGER_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:4578
```

All GCP services are immediately available at `http://localhost:4578`. Credentials are not validated.
